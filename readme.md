# What the Commit

**GitHub Action for committing messages from http://whatthecommit.com**

This is a GitHub Action that changes the last commit and replaces it with a commit message from whatthecommit.com

_A submission for the [DEV: GitHub Actions For Open Source!](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-3ljn) hackathon_

> _Risky for repos that have forks ‚ùó_

### Setup

1. **Add a workflow file** to your project (e.g. `.github/workflows/commit.yml`) with this:

   ```yml
   name: New Commit

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
         - master
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main
         - master

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Use Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v1
           with:
             node-version: '12.x'
         - name: Prettify Commit
           uses: dephraiim/whatthecommit-action@main
   ```

### Commiting

Using the workflow above, GitHub will modify the last commit with a commit message from http://whatthecommit.com
